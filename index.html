<p>It feels like not that long ago that I was on a show called 'Young Hercules' in which I had a fake tan and wore tight leather pants and fought imaginary monsters. For example, the sun goes up and then it goes down. I was very excited. Anything by Disney makes me cry. And I just turn up the parts of myself that are them and turn down the parts that aren't.

My character seems to think that he is, so he would define it. You tell me where we start, where we're going, where we're going afterwards. I drive. In most movies you spend so much time looking for any scraps of truth, and in this movie you're just marinating in it. The pictures which will be accompanying this interview are basically of me in tight wet T-shirts and tiny leather jackets going around in the rain and pretending that I'm a lot cooler than I am.

I went through puberty in a theme park. I wrote you everyday for a year. I fantasized about robbing banks for a long time, ever since I was a kid. You have a shelf life as an actor, so you have to find another way to express yourself. But everytime that happens, what do you get? You get a new day.

Anything happens in that five minutes, then I'm yours, no matter what. I try not to make too many movies. I wrote you 365 letters. If I drive for you, you give me a time and a place, I give you a five minute window. I hear about actors who become the role and I think 'I wonder what that feels like'.

I relate to these characters because aspects of their personality are like me. I'm really not good at knowing what people want, because don't have that talent. You just have to hang out in places that are more interesting than you are. Do you understand? I give you five minutes when we get there.</p>
